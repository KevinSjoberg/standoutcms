Hi there!

We heard you loud and clear. You need a new password. I guess that the
best thing for you would be to pick a new password for yourself, right?

Ok, so if you follow the link below you can do exactly that - pick your own password.

<%= url_for(:controller => 'users', :action => 'password_reset', :id => @user.id, :code => @user.password_reset_code, :only_path => false) %>

This link will only work one time. This is for your safety, so someone else can not change your password.

Have fun!

/ David
