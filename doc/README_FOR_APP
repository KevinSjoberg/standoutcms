Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.

=== Development notes

Text (regular text fields)
Images (regular images. Resizeable and cuttable)
Plugin content (enter name of plugin? Settings box?)

=== First login
The migrations should have created a user with e-mail address admin@example.com and password 'admin'.
Use it to log in and change the password.

=== Plugins or "Extras"
Plugins or Extras are application add-ons that enables more functionality to the user's webpage. This application does not handle all
plugin functionality, only uploaded plugin files (publishing through FTP), managing the list of 
available plugins and which customer who uses which plugin. 

This could be used for billing purposes, since each plugin can have a cost associated with it. 
All other plugin functionality is maintained through another application called standoutcms-plugins.
Authentication is handled by sending the customer ID along with an authentication key.
